## Project Overview  
For this project we visualized heart disease data and used machine learning to predict if a patient is at risk of heart disease based on BRFSS data (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System).  

## The Process  
### Part 1: The Data  
[BRFSS](/https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html) data is a yearly phone (landline and cell) survey in the US conducted by the CDC. The survey collects health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. The [Diabetes Health Indicators dataset](/https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/891/cdc+diabetes+health+indicators) we use contains preprocessed data intended to study the relationship between lifestyle and diabetes in the US. For this project, we decided to use this dataset to study heart disease risk instead (the [csv file](/Resources/diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv) can be found in the Resources folder).  
Sample of the dataset:

### Part 2: Machine Learning Model  
Colab blah blah  
hyperparameters blah  

### Part 3: Visualizations  
To be able to create the visualizations in Tableau, the data needed to be decoded using the [BRFSS Codebook](/https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2015/pdf/2015_calculated_variables_version4.pdf), [Survey Questionnaire](/https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/questionnaires/pdf-ques/2015-brfss-questionnaire-12-29-14.pdf), and the variables table from the [UCI dataset website](/https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/891/cdc+diabetes+health+indicators). For example, the data used codes for respondent's [income](/readme_imgs/questionnaire_income.png), [education level](/readme_imgs/questionnaire_education.png), and [age group](/readme_imgs/codebook_ages.png).  

Tableau blah blah blah

## Project Conclusions:  
ðŸ’– Heart disease will be cured by next year. ðŸ’–  
âœ¨ Happy holidays! âœ¨
